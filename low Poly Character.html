    <h1>Low Poly Character Design</h1>
    <h2>over view</h2>
    <p> I made a low poly charater using blender. We will rig this character and make some animations for it, and use it in a game that we are making this year.  </p>
    <H2>End user</H2>
    <P> The end users for my charater and game, are people who like pirtates and adventrue games. </P>
    <h2>requirements and specifications</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Head-bandana</li>
        <li>Body-made of two squares</li>
        <li>legs-made up of two rectangles each</li>
        <li>Feet-shapped into being more round</li>
        <li>Arms-shapped into shoudlers</li>
        <li>Hands-made up of four fingers attached to a rectangle</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Relevent Implications</h2>
<p>Aesthetic considerations are the way that my character looks visually overall. This is important because if the chracter doesnt look good people would be less intrested in the game and it wouldnt be good. I addressed my characterâ€™s aesthetics by making sure that the blocks were all connected properly making it look more natural and making sure that i payed close attention to detail. </p>
